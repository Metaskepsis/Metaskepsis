With this new page, I can refine the keywords and summary as follows:

**Updated Keywords:**

I'll add the following keywords:

* `Heisenberg groups`
* `Hypoelliptic heat kernel inequalities`
* `Subelliptic operators`
* `Carnot-Caratheodory vector fields`
* `Lie groups`
* `Transport inequalities`
* `Gradient estimates`
* `Ricci curvature`

I'll keep the existing keywords, as they are still relevant to the paper.

**Updated Summary:**

The paper provides a comprehensive list of references related to Riemannian manifolds, heat kernel estimates, probability theory, and geometric analysis on Lie groups and Heisenberg groups. The references cover various topics, including Riesz transform, Sobolev inequalities, logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, heat kernel regularity, symmetric semi-groups, and non-explosion criterion. The authors have also addressed a mistake in the original version of the article, thanks to a referee's feedback.
