**Updated Keywords:** I've added the following keywords: **Heisenberg Group**, **Hormander Vector Fields**, **Subelliptic Operators**, **Hypoellipticity**, **Carnot-Caratheodory Vector Fields**, and **Lie Groups**. I've refined the existing keywords to better reflect the content of the paper.

**Updated Summary:** The authors provide an extensive list of references related to geometric analysis, Riemannian geometry, and heat kernel estimates. The paper appears to focus on heat kernel inequalities, Riesz transforms, and diffusions on Riemannian manifolds, with a particular emphasis on Heisenberg groups and subelliptic operators. The references cited include works by prominent mathematicians in the field, suggesting a comprehensive treatment of the topic.
